Of course. Here is the modified game roadmap tailored for development with Python's Pygame library.

# Farming Simulation Game - Design Documentation

## Project Overview
**Genre:** 2D Top-down Grid-based Farming Simulation  
**Engine:** Python with Pygame library  
**Style:** Realistic farming with strategic management (RimWorld-inspired UI)  
**Target:** Solo development project  
**Core Theme:** Educational agricultural management showing "how fun and crazy agriculture really is"

## Story & Setting
The player inherits farmland after finishing college with $0 in savings. They must build an agricultural business from scratch using loans, government subsidies, and strategic management.

## Core Game Loop
1.  **Morning Planning:** Assign tasks, check employee needs, and review market prices.
2.  **Day Execution:** Employees work in their assigned areas while the player manages and optimizes operations.
3.  **Evening Review:** Assess harvest results, pay wages, and plan for the next day.
4.  **Market Interaction:** Sell produce, buy supplies, and manage loans.

## MVP SPECIFICATIONS (Phase 1)

### Technical Foundation
*   **Grid Size:** 16x16 tiles
*   **Time System:** A 20-minute workday (5am-6pm), running in real-time with pause and speed controls.
*   **Save System:** Manual save and hardcore auto-save options, likely using Python's `pickle` or `json` modules to serialize game state.
*   **UI Style:** Clean, tooltip-heavy, RimWorld-inspired. This will require a dedicated UI library (e.g., Pygame GUI) or a significant custom implementation.

### Core Systems

#### 1. GRID SYSTEM
```python
# Each tile could be an object or a dictionary in a 2D list:
class Tile:
    def __init__(self, terrain_type, soil_quality):
        self.terrain_type = terrain_type  # e.g., 'soil', 'grass'
        self.soil_quality = soil_quality  # 1-10
        self.current_crop = None
        self.growth_stage = 0
        self.water_level = 100
        self.task_assignment = None # e.g., 'till', 'plant'
```

#### 2. CROP SYSTEM (Corn Only)
*   **Growth Stages:** Seed → Sprout → Young → Mature → Harvestable
*   **Timeline:** 3 in-game days total (shortened to 10 minutes for testing).
*   **Yield:** Calculated based on soil quality and care provided.
*   **Revenue:** Subject to dynamic market pricing.

#### 3. EMPLOYEE SYSTEM (1 Employee)
**Core Stats:**
*   **Walking Speed:** Measured in tiles per second.
*   **Skill Level:** An efficiency modifier.
*   **Stamina:** Determines maximum work capacity.

**Needs System:**
*   **Hunger:** A 0-100 scale that decreases over time.
*   **Thirst:** A 0-100 scale that decreases faster than hunger.
*   **Rest:** A 0-100 scale that decreases with work and is restored by rest.

**Basic Traits:** (procedurally assigned)
*   **Hard Worker:** Provides a +10% efficiency bonus but has a -5% stamina drain.
*   **Runner:** Moves at a +10% faster speed.

#### 4. TASK SYSTEM
**Available Tasks:**
*   **Tilling:** Preparing soil for planting.
*   **Planting:** Placing seeds in tilled soil.
*   **Harvesting:** Collecting mature crops.

**Assignment Method:** Drag-and-drop area selection on the grid.
**AI Behavior:** The employee will use a pathfinding algorithm to navigate to assigned areas and work until the task is complete or a need becomes critical.

#### 5. ECONOMY SYSTEM
**Starting Conditions:**
*   $0 cash.
*   A mandatory first-time farmer loan of $10,000 with low interest.
*   A government subsidy of $100 per day for the first 30 days.

**Daily Expenses:**
*   **Employee wage:** $100/day base rate.
*   **Loan payments:** Calculated based on loan terms.
*   **Utilities:** $20/day for electricity.

**Revenue Streams:**
*   **Crop sales:** Prices determined by a dynamic market.
*   **Government contracts:** Opportunities for seasonal work.

**Payment Options:**
*   **Daily payment:** Pays the full wage and maintains employee morale.
*   **Weekly payment:** Results in a -10% morale and -5% work efficiency penalty.

#### 6. MARKET SYSTEM
*   **Corn prices:** Fluctuate daily between $2 and $8 per unit.
*   **Price factors:** A simulated supply and demand model.
*   **Price calculation:** The price for the next day is determined at the end of the current day to ensure consistency with the save system.

*   **Employee AI Complexity:** Pathfinding and task coordination remain complex to implement.
*   **Save System:** Managing the state of all game objects for serialization can be complex.
*   **Balance:** Creating an economy that is challenging but not punishing.

### Medium Risk
*   **Performance:** Real-time simulation on larger grids may require significant optimization in Python.

### Low Risk
*   **Basic Systems:** The grid logic, crop growth timers, and simple transactions are straightforward to implement.
*   **Art Assets:** Creating 2D top-down sprites is generally not a complex task.

## CONCLUSION

This design provides a solid foundation for an educational farming simulation using Python and Pygame. It balances realism with engaging gameplay. The MVP focuses on the core mechanics, leaving room for the complex agricultural systems that will make this game a unique entry in the farming simulation genre.

The phased development approach allows for iterative testing and refinement, which is crucial for a solo developer's first major project. Each phase builds logically on the previous one, ensuring a stable foundation before complexity is added.
