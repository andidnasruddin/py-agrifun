  - `H` - Assign Harvest task to selected tiles
  - `C` - Clear tile selection
  - `F1` - Toggle debug information (pathfinding visualization)
- **UI Elements**: Speed controls (Pause, 1x, 2x, 4x), hiring system, building placement, irrigation controls

### Game Flow:
1. Start with $0 cash and a mandatory $10,000 farmer loan
2. Receive $100/day government subsidy for first 30 days
3. **Hire employees** through the strategic hiring system - each with unique traits and specializations
4. **Choose your crops** based on seasons, soil conditions, and contract opportunities
5. **Install irrigation systems** for drought protection and consistent yields
6. **Build infrastructure** (storage silos, water coolers, tool sheds, employee housing)
7. **Accept contracts** for guaranteed pricing or sell at optimal market timing
8. **Manage soil health** through crop rotation and scientific farming practices
9. **Adapt to weather** events and seasonal changes affecting your crops

## Advanced Game Systems

### Agricultural Science & Education:
- **Soil Chemistry**: N-P-K nutrient levels affect crop yields and require strategic management
- **Crop Rotation**: Educational agricultural principles with yield bonuses for proper rotation
- **Weather Integration**: Seasonal patterns affecting planting windows and growth rates
- **Irrigation Strategy**: Investment vs. operational cost decisions for drought mitigation

### Strategic Business Management:
- **Contract System**: Accept guaranteed-price contracts vs. market speculation
- **Farm Specialization**: Choose focus areas that optimize your operation for specific goals
- **Multi-Crop Planning**: Balance fast-growth tomatoes, stable wheat, and profitable corn
- **Infrastructure Investment**: Tool sheds boost efficiency, employee housing reduces commute times

### Sophisticated Employee Systems:
