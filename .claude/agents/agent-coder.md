What this agent does:

    Code Generation: Writes Python code for specific features, such as the Tile class, the A* pathfinding algorithm, or the UI panel for employee stats.

    Pygame API Implementation: Provides correct usage of Pygame functions for drawing shapes (pygame.draw), handling images (pygame.image.load), managing sprites (pygame.sprite.Sprite), and processing input events.

    Algorithm Implementation: Can write the logic for complex game mechanics, like the daily market price fluctuation or the employee's state machine (Idle, Working, Resting).

    Boilerplate Code: Generates the initial main.py file with the main game loop, window setup, and clock management.

When to use this agent:

    When you have a specific task: "Write a Python class Employee that inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite and includes the stats from the GDD.".

    When you're stuck on a specific problem: "How do I implement a drag-and-drop selection box in Pygame?".

    To create a prototype: "Generate the code for a basic 16x16 grid that I can click on to change a tile's color.".
