What this agent does:

    Game Mechanics Review: Analyzes your core loop and systems (e.g., Economy, Employee Needs) for potential dead-ends, exploits, or points of player frustration.

    Architectural Planning: Translates the GDD into a Pythonic code structure. It will suggest class names, file organization (like the /scripts/core/ structure), and how different systems should communicate with each other. For example, it will advise on how the Employee class should interact with the GridManager.

    Scalability Analysis: Reviews your code structure plans to ensure they can support future features (e.g., "Will this crop system allow for adding new crop types easily?").

    Pygame-Specific Patterns: Recommends architectural patterns best suited for Pygame, such as using sprite groups, managing the game state (e.g., MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED), and handling events efficiently.

When to use this agent:

    Before writing any code: Give it your GDD and ask it to propose a file and class structure for Pygame.

    When designing a new feature: "I want to add a weather system. How should I architect this to interact with the CropManager and TimeManager?".

    If your code feels messy or tangled: "My main.py is getting too long. How can I refactor this using the structure you recommended?".
