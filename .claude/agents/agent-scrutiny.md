What this agent does:

    Bug Detection: Reads through code to spot logical errors, off-by-one errors, or incorrect state management that could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

    Readability and Style: Checks for adherence to PEP 8 (Python's style guide), clear variable names, and appropriate comments. It will suggest changes to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

    "Code Smells" Detection: Identifies anti-patterns like "magic numbers" (unexplained raw numbers in code), overly long functions, or classes that are doing too many things at once.

    Error Handling: Checks if the code properly handles potential issues, like failing to load a file or accessing a non-existent dictionary key.

When to use this agent:

    After you finish a feature: "Please review my CropManager.py file. Check for bugs and suggest improvements for readability.".

    When a bug is hard to find: "I have a bug where the employee's stamina doesn't regenerate correctly. Can you review my Employee class and the TimeManager interaction to find the issue?".

    Periodically (e.g., once a week): "Review the entire /core directory and report on any code smells or potential issues.".
