# Hiring System Restoration - Complete

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL  
**Priority**: HIGH (User-blocking issue resolved)

## 🎯 Issue Summary

**Problem**: The user discovered that hiring functionality was completely disabled for debugging purposes, making it impossible to hire additional workers despite the multi-employee system being fully implemented in the backend.

**Root Cause**: Interview system was temporarily disabled and never re-enabled, leaving users unable to access the core hiring functionality.

**Solution**: Implemented streamlined Simple Hiring System that provides direct hiring without complex interview mechanics.
