### What Kinds of Needs Do Employees Have During Work?

Needs are states that decay over time or with exertion, and if ignored, they impose penalties. Fulfilling them provides temporary buffs and keeps employees functional.

1.  **Stamina/Energy (Your "Energy"):**
    *   **Decays with:** Physical labor (tilling, harvesting), carrying heavy loads, working in extreme weather (heat/cold).
    *   **Fulfilled by:** Taking breaks in a **Common Room**, sitting on a bench, or a full night's rest.
    *   **Penalty for Low:** Movement and work speed drastically slow down. Increased chance of accidents or mistakes. At 0, the employee will stop working and seek a place to rest.

2.  **Hunger:**
    *   **Decays:** Over the course of the workday, faster with heavy labor.
    *   **Fulfilled by:** Eating a meal at the **Canteen** or a packed lunch at a designated break area.
    *   **Penalty for Low:** Stamina drains faster, morale drops, and minor work speed penalty.

3.  **Thirst:**
    *   **Decays:** Constantly, but much faster in hot weather or during heavy exertion.
    *   **Fulfilled by:** Drinking from a **Water Cooler**, a tap in the Canteen, or a personal water bottle.
    *   **Penalty for Low:** Massive work speed penalty (especially in summer), stamina drains much faster.

4.  **Bladder:**
    *   **Decays:** After drinking. A simple, realistic need.
    *   **Fulfilled by:** Using a **Bathroom** or outhouse.
    *   **Penalty for Low:** A severe "distracted" debuff, causing slower work and a huge morale drop. If it hits zero, they will stop everything and run to the nearest facility.

5.  **Social:**
    *   **Decays:** When working alone for long periods. Different traits affect the decay rate ("Introvert" vs. "Extrovert").
    *   **Fulfilled by:** Chatting with colleagues in the **Common Room**, during lunch at the Canteen, or during collaborative tasks.
    *   **Penalty for Low:** Morale drain. For "Extrovert" types, it can also lead to them stopping work to find someone to talk to.

### What Other Aspects Would Make Sense? (Expanding the Profile)

Your default stats are a great baseline for *physical capabilities*. Let's add layers for *progression, personality, and well-being*.

1.  **Experience Points (XP) & Levels:**
    *   Employees gain XP for every task they complete.
    *   Upon leveling up, they gain a small boost to a relevant stat (e.g., leveling up from farming tasks could slightly increase their movement speed or carry weight).
    *   At milestone levels (e.g., 5, 10), they might unlock a new **Perk**, which is like a minor, earned Trait (e.g., "Efficient Harvester" or "Tireless Walker"). This creates a rewarding progression loop for each employee.

2.  **Age & Career Stage:**
    *   Employees age over the years. This isn't just a number; it affects their capabilities.
        *   **Young (18-25):** High stamina, fast, but lower starting skills and more prone to mistakes.
        *   **Prime (26-45):** The best balance of physical stats and experience.
        *   **Veteran (46-60):** Physical stats begin to slowly decline (- movement speed), but their high skill level compensates with efficiency. May gain a "Mentor" trait that helps nearby junior employees gain XP faster.
        *   **Senior (>60):** Significant physical penalties, but their vast experience makes them excellent for supervisory or highly specialized, low-exertion roles (like an R&D Scientist).

3.  **Stress Meter:**
    *   Different from Morale. This measures their mental strain.
    *   **Increases with:** Being overworked (low Stamina for too long), working with clashing personalities (Rivals), failing at tasks, or being micromanaged.
    *   **Decreases with:** Successful task completion, getting a raise, relaxing in the Common Room.
    *   **High Stress leads to:** Higher chance of mistakes, faster morale drain, and can eventually lead to a "Burnout" state where the employee is ineffective for several days.

4.  **Ambition (Hidden Trait):**
    *   This dictates an employee's career goals.
        *   **Highly Ambitious:** Their morale will plummet if they aren't promoted, trained, or given a raise regularly. They are driven but high-maintenance.
        *   **Content:** They are happy performing the same roles for years as long as they are paid fairly. Reliable and stable.
        *   **Wanderer:** Prone to quitting after a few years to "seek new opportunities," regardless of morale. Great for the short-term, but not a long-term investment.
