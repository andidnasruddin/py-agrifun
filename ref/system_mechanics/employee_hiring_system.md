### The Core Philosophy: From Human Resources to Human Capital

We are not just hiring "workers." We are investing in **Human Capital**. This means every applicant has a past, every employee has a present, and their future with your farm is something you actively shape through investment, training, and management.

### Pillar 1: Sourcing & Recruitment - Casting the Net

This pillar is about how you find talent. Different channels provide different types of applicants, creating your first strategic choice.

*   **1. The Community Job Board (Early Game):**
    *   **Source:** The local town. Low cost to post a job.
    *   **Applicants:** Generally low-skill, looking for seasonal or entry-level work. They have no relocation costs. A great source for short-term "Harvest Hands."
    *   **The Catch:** The talent pool is small and refreshes slowly. You won't find a specialist Tractor Operator here.

*   **2. The Agricultural Recruitment Agency (Mid-Game):**
    *   **Source:** A professional headhunting firm.
    *   **Applicants:** A wider range of skills, from experienced farmhands to specialists (Mechanics, Agronomists). They are actively looking for long-term, full-time careers.
    *   **The Catch:** This is expensive. You pay a hefty **Hiring Fee** (e.g., 25% of their first-year salary) to the agency. Applicants may also have **Relocation Costs** you have to cover if they're from out of town.

*   **3. Headhunting (Late-Game):**
    *   **Source:** You identify a star employee working at a competing (NPC) farm.
    *   **Mechanic:** You can make them a secret offer. This is incredibly expensive (signing bonus, high salary), and there's a chance it could fail or damage your reputation with other farms if word gets out.
    *   **The Catch:** The ultimate high-risk, high-reward hiring move to acquire a "legendary" employee.

### Pillar 2: The Interview - The Art of the Reveal

This is the core of the discovery process, a mini-game of deduction and psychology.

*   **The Setup:** The hiring UI shows you an applicant's name, their requested salary, their core **Skills** (e.g., Farming: 3/10, Mechanical: 1/10), and their previous job titles (e.g., "Cashier," "Apprentice Mechanic"). **Their Traits are all hidden.**
*   **The Mini-Game: Interview Points (IP):**
    *   You have a limited pool of IP for each interview (e.g., 5 points).
    *   You have a list of questions, each costing IP.
        *   **Background Questions (1 IP):** "Tell me about your time as an Apprentice Mechanic." This can reveal basic traits or confirm skill levels.
        *   **Situational Questions (2 IP):** "A valuable piece of equipment breaks down in the field during a storm. What's your immediate reaction?" The answer reveals a critical trait.
            *   *"I'd try a quick fix to get the harvest in before the storm ruins it."* -> **Reveals: Impulsive / Risk-Taker.**
            *   *"I'd shut it down immediately to prevent more damage and call the workshop."* -> **Reveals: Careful / By-the-Book.**
        *   **Reference Check (3 IP):** The most expensive option. You call their previous employer. This has a high chance to reveal a "secret" positive or negative trait (e.g., "Always punctual" or "Struggled with authority").
*   **The Bluff Mechanic:** Some applicants (especially those with the hidden "Deceitful" trait) might lie during the interview. Only a "Reference Check" or a high player-manager skill can see through the lie. You might hire someone who sounds "Diligent" but is actually "Lazy."

### Pillar 3: Onboarding & Contracts - Sealing the Deal

Hiring isn't just a click. It's a negotiation.

*   **The Offer:** Based on the interview, you construct a job offer. This includes:
    *   **Salary:** You can offer their requested salary, or try to negotiate it down (risking they reject the offer) or offer more to secure a star candidate.
    *   **Contract Type:**
        *   **Seasonal:** Fixed term (e.g., 3 months). No benefits. Perfect for short-term hires.
        *   **Full-Time:** Permanent employment. More stable, but requires benefits.
    *   **Benefits Package (Optional):** You can add perks like a housing stipend or health insurance. These cost you money but dramatically boost the employee's starting **Morale**.
    *   **Signing Bonus:** A one-time cash payment to seal the deal. Essential for relocation or headhunting.

### Pillar 4: Development & Management - The Long Game

This is where you turn your investment into a high-performing team.

*   **Skills vs. Traits:**
    *   **Skills (Trainable):** Numerical values (1-10) for specific jobs: Farming, Mechanical, Agronomy, Logistics, etc. They improve slowly with practice or quickly with formal training.
    *   **Traits (Innate):** Personality descriptors that are mostly permanent. They provide buffs and debuffs. (e.g., **Diligent:** +10% work speed; **Pessimist:** -5% morale in bad weather; **Fast Learner:** Gains skill 25% faster).

*   **Training & Certification (The Investment):**
    *   You can pay to send an employee to a training course.
    *   **Mechanic:** They are unavailable for a week and it costs $5,000. They return with a "Basic Tractor Maintenance" certification and +2 to their Mechanical skill.
    *   **Impact:** Certifications are **required** to use or repair advanced machinery. You can't just have any farmhand operate your new $500k combine. This creates a critical path for progression.

*   **The Morale System (Replaces "Happiness"):**
    *   A deep, multi-faceted metric. High morale = higher work speed, fewer accidents, and positive social interactions. Low morale = sloppy work, higher chance of quitting, and conflicts.
    *   **Influenced by:**
        *   **Compensation:** Are they paid fairly for their skill level?
        *   **Workload:** Are they constantly overworked and exhausted? (Links to **Task System**)
        *   **Amenities:** Is there a clean bathroom, a nice canteen? (Links to **Building System**)
        *   **Team Cohesion:** Do they get along with their colleagues? (Some traits will clash!)
        *   **Feeling Valued:** Have they received a raise or training opportunity recently?

### Pillar 5: Separation - The Repercussions

Losing an employee, either by choice or not, should have consequences.

*   **Quitting:** If morale hits rock bottom, an employee will quit. They will take their skills and experience with them. A disgruntled employee might also steal a few tools or leave a bad review at the recruitment agency, increasing your hiring fees for a period.
*   **Firing:**
    *   You can fire anyone, but it will cause a significant, temporary morale drop for your entire remaining staff. They'll be scared they are next.
    *   **Severance Pay:** Firing a long-term, full-time employee will require you to pay severance, a sudden and painful economic hit.
    *   **Wrongful Dismissal Event:** Firing a loyal, high-morale employee without good cause might trigger a random event where they sue you, leading to a potential legal battle or a hefty settlement.

### Linking to All Other Systems

This system is designed to be the central nervous system of your farm.

*   **üîó Economy System:** Directly impacts your finances through salaries, hiring fees, relocation costs, training fees, severance pay, and building amenity costs.
*   **üîó Fleet Management System:** Employee skill and traits directly determine equipment wear and tear, repair success, fuel efficiency, and the risk of breakdowns. Certifications are required to operate high-tier machinery.
*   **üîó Task Management System:** Employee work speed, stamina, and traits determine how quickly and effectively tasks are completed. Low morale leads to slower work.
*   **üîó Agricultural System:** Specialized skills like "Pest Scouting" or "Soil Analysis" are required for advanced agricultural tasks. A "Green Thumb" trait can increase crop yields.
*   **üîó Research System:** Requires hiring a highly specialized **Scientist/Agronomist**. Their skill and traits determine the speed and success rate of your R&D projects.
*   **üîó Building System:** Employee needs (like hunger, bladder, social) drive the necessity for building amenities like canteens, bathrooms, and common rooms.

This design ensures that the player is constantly evaluating trade-offs, making tough personnel decisions, and feeling the ripple effects of those choices across their entire farm operation. It's not just about hiring the best; it's about building the best team you can with the flawed, interesting people you can find.

Of course. Since both provided charts describe the same complete "Employee Management System," combining them means presenting that single, unified system.

This is a fantastic system to visualize because it's a complete lifecycle. The key to making a complex chart "easy to understand" is to group concepts logically and show a clear flow from start to finish. I've used subgraphs to represent each major stage of the employee's journey with your farm: **Sourcing, Interviewing, Onboarding, Management, and Separation.** This creates a clear visual narrative.

Here is the sophisticated, thorough, and complex‚Äîbut clearly structured‚ÄîMermaid chart for your Employee Management System.
