### The Agri-Sim Engine

This chart visualizes the game as four primary interconnected layers, creating a dynamic feedback loop that drives gameplay:

1.  **The Player's Command Center (Top Layer):** This is the meta-layer, representing *you*, the manager. It's where your permanent legacy (**Grit**) and your in-run tactical abilities (**Ingenuity**) reside. This layer doesn't manage the farm directly; it provides global buffs, unlocks new possibilities, and offers emergency interventions, influencing every other aspect of the game.

2.  **The Strategic & Expansion Layer (CEO View):** This is where you make the big-picture, long-term decisions. You manage the empire's **Finances**, plan your growth across the **Multi-Farm World Map**, and steer your long-term competitive advantage through **Research & Technology**. This layer sets the grand strategy.

3.  **The Core Farm Operations (Manager View):** This is the heart of the simulation‚Äîthe hands-on, day-to-day management of your farms. It includes managing **Employees** and their needs, maintaining the **Fleet** of equipment and tools, handling the physical **Water**, **Processing, and Storage** of goods. This layer is where your grand strategy is executed.

4.  **The Living World (External Forces):** This layer represents the forces outside of your direct control that constantly challenge you and create opportunities. Aggressive **Rivals** compete for every resource, while **Dynamic Events & Scenarios** can upend your best-laid plans or offer unexpected windfalls. This layer ensures that no two games are ever the same.

**The Intertwined Loop:** The **Living World** creates problems and opportunities. The player uses their **Strategic Layer** to plan a response, which is then executed by the **Core Operations Layer**. The success or failure of these operations feeds back into the Strategic Layer (as profit/loss) and ultimately provides the experience that fuels the **Player's Command Center** for future runs.
