## üåø Branching Strategy

### Main Branches
- **main**: Stable, working code only
- **develop**: Integration branch for ongoing development
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/***: Critical bug fixes

### Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # If working with remote
git checkout -b feature/employee-pathfinding

# Work on feature with frequent commits
git add scripts/employee/pathfinding.py
git commit -m "feat: Add A* pathfinding implementation"

git add scripts/employee/employee.py  
git commit -m "feat: Integrate pathfinding with employee AI"

# Merge back to develop when complete
git checkout develop
git merge feature/employee-pathfinding
git branch -d feature/employee-pathfinding
```

### Phase Transition Workflow
```bash
# Create phase branch for major milestones
git checkout main
git checkout -b phase-2-enhanced-systems

# Merge develop into phase branch
git merge develop

# When phase complete, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge phase-2-enhanced-systems
git tag -a v2.0 -m "Phase 2: Enhanced Systems Complete"
```

## üìä Session Management

### Start of Session Checklist
1. **Review context**: Read DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md and BUG_LOG.md
2. **Check git status**: `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`
3. **Test current state**: `python main.py` to verify functionality
4. **Resume from checkpoint**: Use `claude --resume` if continuing work

### During Development
```bash
# Commit frequently with meaningful messages
git add <files>
git commit -m "<type>: <description>

Context: <current work and next steps>"

# Update context files as work progresses
# Commit context updates separately
git add DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md BUG_LOG.md
git commit -m "docs: Update development context

- Mark feature X as completed
- Add bug Y to tracking
- Update next session priorities"
```

### End of Session Protocol  
```bash
# Ensure all work is committed
git status  # Should be clean

# Update all context files
git add DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md BUG_LOG.md
git commit -m "docs: End-of-session context update

Phase: <current phase>
Completed: <what was accomplished>
Next: <priorities for next session>
Issues: <any new bugs discovered>

# Tag major milestones
git tag -a session-$(date +%Y%m%d) -m "Development session $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

## üîç Context Recovery Commands

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# See recent development history
git log --oneline -10

# Check what's changed since last session  
git diff HEAD~1

# See current branch and status
git status
git branch -v
```

### Detailed Context Recovery
```bash
# See commits since specific date
git log --since="2 days ago" --oneline

# Find specific bug fix commits
git log --grep="fix:" --oneline

# See file-specific history
git log -p scripts/core/game_manager.py

# Find when feature was implemented
git log --grep="pathfinding" --oneline
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# If context is lost, check recent commit messages
git log -5 --format="%h %s %b"

# Find last working state
git log --grep="working" --oneline

# Revert to last stable state if needed
git checkout <commit-hash>
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```

## üéØ Integration with Claude Code

### Memory File Updates
```bash
# After significant architectural changes
git add ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md
git commit -m "docs: Document new event system patterns

- Add event-driven UI update pattern
- Document manager initialization order  
- Note performance considerations

Context: For future Claude Code sessions to understand system design"
```

### Checkpoint Creation
```bash
# Create checkpoints at logical stopping points
git tag -a checkpoint-ui-complete -m "UI system implementation complete

Features working:
- pygame-gui integration
- Resource panels and speed controls  
- Task assignment keyboard shortcuts
- Debug mode toggle

Next: Implement storage system for harvested crops
Known issues: See BUG_LOG.md entries BUG-002, BUG-005"
```

### Branch Naming for Claude Code
Use descriptive branch names that provide context:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/storage-system-for-crops
git checkout -b fix/employee-pathfinding-issues  
git checkout -b refactor/economy-manager-cleanup
git checkout -b phase-2/interview-system-prep
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Do This
- Commit WIP code without explaining current state
- Use generic messages like "fix bugs" or "update code"
- Forget to update context files before committing
- Work on main branch directly
- Let multiple features accumulate in single commit

### Do This Instead
- Commit working incremental changes with clear context
- Reference bug numbers and explain what was fixed
- Update DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md when completing features
- Use feature branches for experimental changes
- Separate feature commits from documentation commits

## üöÄ Integration with Development Tools

### VS Code Integration
```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
    "git.inputValidationLength": 100,
    "git.inputValidationSubjectLength": 72,
    "git.defaultCloneDirectory": "./branches"
}
```

### Git Hooks (Optional)
```bash
# Pre-commit hook to ensure context files are updated
#!/bin/sh
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "scripts/"; then
    if ! git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md"; then
        echo "Warning: Code changes without DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md update"
        echo "Consider updating context files before committing"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

This workflow ensures that each git commit provides sufficient context for future development sessions and helps prevent the bug introduction that occurs when context is lost between sessions.
