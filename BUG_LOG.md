## üêõ Active Issues

### High Priority

*No high priority issues currently active*

#### BUG-001: Employee Direct Movement Pathfinding
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-01-28
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Employee uses direct line movement instead of proper pathfinding  
**Solution**: Implemented A* pathfinding algorithm with visual debugging
**Technical Details**: 
- Created `pathfinding.py` with complete A* implementation
- Updated `employee.py` to use pathfinding for movement
- Added path visualization for debugging
- Includes path caching and optimization
- Fallback to direct movement if pathfinding fails
**Verification**: 
- Employee now follows optimal paths between waypoints
- Visual path debugging shows green lines and waypoint markers
- Performance tested on 16x16 grid with no issues

#### BUG-002: Automatic Crop Sales
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-08-11  
**Severity**: Was Low  
**Description**: Strategic inventory system implemented with manual selling  
**Solution**: Complete inventory management with FIFO selling, quality tracking  
**Technical Details**: 
- Full inventory system in `inventory_manager.py` with 100-unit base capacity

- Quality-based pricing and harvest date tracking
- Building system integration for storage upgrades

#### BUG-003: Task Assignment Validation
**Status**: üî¥ Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: Limited validation when assigning inappropriate tasks  
**Reproduction**:
1. Try to plant on untilled soil
2. Try to harvest non-mature crops  
3. Tasks get assigned but can't be completed
**Impact**: Player confusion when tasks don't execute  
**Technical Details**:
- `_can_assign_task()` in `grid_manager.py` has basic validation
- Employee will move to tile but can't complete invalid tasks
**Solution**: Better pre-assignment validation and user feedback  
**Priority**: Polish phase  
**Workaround**: Players learn valid task sequences quickly

### Medium Priority

#### BUG-004: Employee Stuck States
**Status**: üî¥ Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: Employee can get stuck in certain edge cases  
**Reproduction**: 
1. Assign task while employee is resting
2. Employee might not transition back to work properly
**Impact**: Employee becomes unresponsive until needs change  
**Technical Details**: State machine transitions in `employee.py`  
**Solution**: Better state transition handling and timeouts  
**Priority**: Polish phase  
**Workaround**: Speed up time or wait for needs to change state

#### BUG-005: UI Tooltip Missing
**Status**: üî¥ Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: No tooltips implemented despite design specification  
**Impact**: Poor user experience for new players  
**Technical Details**: pygame-gui tooltip system not implemented  
**Solution**: Add comprehensive tooltip system  
**Priority**: UI polish phase  
**Workaround**: README provides controls documentation

#### BUG-006: Market Price Edge Cases
**Status**: üî¥ Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: Market price can theoretically hit exact min/max bounds  
**Reproduction**: Very rare, requires specific random sequences  
**Impact**: Price stuck at boundary for multiple days  
**Technical Details**: `update_corn_price()` in `economy_manager.py`  
**Solution**: Better price volatility algorithm with guaranteed variance  
**Priority**: Balance testing phase  
**Workaround**: Restart game if encountered

### Low Priority

#### BUG-007: Frame Rate Inconsistency
**Status**: üî¥ Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: Occasional frame drops during intensive UI updates  
**Reproduction**: Rapid tile selection with many UI events  
**Impact**: Minor visual stuttering  
**Solution**: Optimize event processing and UI updates  
**Priority**: Performance optimization phase  
**Workaround**: Avoid rapid clicking

#### BUG-008: Employee Needs Display Overlap
**Status**: üî¥ Open  
**Severity**: Trivial  
**Description**: Employee needs bars can overlap with tile highlights  
**Impact**: Minor visual issue  
**Solution**: Better needs bar positioning or transparency  
**Priority**: Visual polish  
**Workaround**: Cosmetic issue only

## ‚úÖ Resolved Issues

### üéâ MAJOR RESOLUTION - Phase 2 (August 2025)

#### BUG-009: Stuck UI Hiring Panel Elements (CRITICAL FIX)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-08-11  
**Severity**: High (Game-breaking UI bug)  
**Description**: Permanent stuck UI elements including 'Strategic Hiring - Available Candidates' text, 'Sort by:' dropdown, and hiring table columns that wouldn't disappear on game startup  
**Impact**: Major - Caused stuck UI elements that blocked normal gameplay  
**Root Cause**: Multiple conflicting visibility management systems in pygame-gui:
  - Four competing systems: `.visible` flags, `.hide()/.show()` methods, internal tracking flags, and startup protection
  - pygame-gui element lifecycle problems with child elements remaining in rendering queue
  - Race conditions between competing visibility control systems
**Solution**: **Complete architectural refactoring of panel management**
  - **Phase 1**: Eliminated conflicting visibility systems and startup protection mechanisms
  - **Phase 2**: Implemented single-source-of-truth using dynamic create/destroy pattern instead of hide/show
  - **Phase 3**: Comprehensive cleanup of all child elements when panels close
**Technical Details**: 
  - Replaced `_hide_applicant_panel()` with `_destroy_applicant_panel()` that completely destroys all child elements
  - Implemented `_applicant_panel_exists` flag for clean state tracking
  - Dynamic panel creation via `_create_applicant_panel()` only when needed
  - Proper pygame-gui element lifecycle with `.kill()` methods
  - Removed all startup protection and competing visibility mechanisms
**Testing**: 
  - ‚úÖ No stuck elements detected on startup
  - ‚úÖ Panel creation/destruction working perfectly
  - ‚úÖ All hiring workflow functionality preserved
  - ‚úÖ Performance unchanged with dynamic creation
**Why Previous Attempts Failed**: 
  - Previous fixes (including Claude Opus 4.1, specialized UI agents) attempted to patch existing complex system
  - This solution addressed the fundamental architecture problem rather than symptoms
  - Root cause was pygame-gui rendering queue management, not just visibility flags
**Fix Location**: Complete refactoring of `scripts/ui/ui_manager.py` panel management system

### Resolved in MVP Phase 1

#### BUG-R001: Event System Queue Overflow
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-01-28  
**Description**: Events could accumulate without processing  
**Solution**: Added event processing at end of each game loop frame  
**Fix Location**: `game_manager.py:run()` - added event processing call

#### BUG-R002: Time Speed Control Not Working
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-01-28  
**Description**: UI speed buttons didn't affect game time  
**Solution**: Proper event connection between UI and time manager  
**Fix Location**: `ui_manager.py:handle_event()` and `time_manager.py:_handle_speed_change()`

#### BUG-R003: Employee Tasks Not Clearing
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Date Resolved**: 2025-01-28  
**Description**: Completed tasks remained assigned to tiles  
**Solution**: Clear task assignment when work completes  
**Fix Location**: `employee.py:_complete_current_tile()`
