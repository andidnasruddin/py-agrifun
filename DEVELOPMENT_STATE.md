3. **Add storage system** for harvested crops
4. **Polish UI feedback** and add tooltips
5. **Create unit tests** for core systems

## üíæ Session Continuity Notes

### Key Context for Future Sessions
- Employee "Sam" has "hard_worker" trait (+10% efficiency, -5% stamina drain)
- Corn growth takes 3 game days, market prices fluctuate daily
- Daily expenses: $20 utilities + ~$27 loan payment + $100 employee wage
- Government subsidy provides $100/day for first 30 days
- Grid uses (0,0) top-left coordinate system with 32px tile size

### Important Implementation Details
- Event system processes events at end of each frame
- Time system uses real seconds * speed_multiplier for game time calculation
- Employee AI updates every frame but pathfinding is instantaneous
- Economy manager handles all financial transactions with event notifications
- UI manager uses pygame-gui for professional interface components

### Critical Files to Review for Context
- `scripts/core/config.py` - All game parameters and constants
- `scripts/core/game_manager.py` - Main coordination and game loop
- `scripts/employee/employee.py` - Employee AI state machine
- `scripts/economy/economy_manager.py` - Financial system logic
