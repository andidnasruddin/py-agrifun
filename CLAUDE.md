### Code Comment Requirements
**IMPORTANT: Line-by-Line Code Explanations Required**

When writing or modifying code, Claude MUST add detailed explanations for every line to help the developer understand what each line does. This is specifically requested by the developer for learning purposes.

**Example Format:**
```python
# Initialize the employee position to center of grid
self.x = 8.0  # Set X coordinate to grid center (8 out of 16)
self.y = 8.0  # Set Y coordinate to grid center (8 out of 16)

# Create task assignment list to store work orders
self.assigned_tasks = []  # Empty list to hold task dictionaries

# Set employee speed from config file
self.speed = EMPLOYEE_SPEED  # Get movement speed from config.py (tiles per second)
```

This applies to:
- ✅ New function implementations
- ✅ Code modifications and updates
- ✅ Bug fixes and improvements
- ✅ System integrations and refactoring

Exception: Simple variable assignments in config files or obvious operations may use shorter comments.

### Development Phases
1. **✅ MVP (Phase 1) - COMPLETED:** Core foundation - grid, multi-employee, crop management, economy
2. **✅ Phase 2 - COMPLETED:** Enhanced systems - hiring system, buildings, advanced AI pathfinding
3. **✅ Phase 3+ - COMPLETED:** Agricultural complexity - crop rotation, soil health, weather systems, irrigation
4. **🔄 Phase 4 (Current):** Additional features - employee traits, technology research, tutorial system

  🎯 DEVELOPMENT STATUS: Professional UI system ready for full feature rollout!
- Perfect! Now the contracts should be displaying properly. The key fixes were:

  1. ✅ Event subscription mismatch: Changed from contracts_data_updated to contract_data_for_ui
  2. ✅ Data field names: Changed from ongoing_contracts to active_contracts
  3. ✅ Data access method: Changed from .get() dictionary access to direct attribute access for dataclass objects
  4. ✅ Data format conversion: Converted quality_requirement from 0.0-1.0 to percentage format

  The contracts interface should now show:
  - Available Contracts panel with contract cards showing buyer name, contract type, crop details, quality requirements,
  deadline, and "Accept Contract" buttons
  - Ongoing Contracts panel with "In Progress" status for accepted contracts
  - Proper scrollable areas under each panel title

  session if desired, but the core functionality is solid! 🎯
- ✅ Employee Submenu System - FULLY FUNCTIONAL & COMPLETE

  Issues Resolved:

  1. ✅ Button Visibility: Fixed submenu buttons appearing as thin lines
  2. ✅ Auto-generation: Removed automatic applicant generation - now only generates when "Begin Search" is clicked

  Success Criteria for Phase 1:
  - Existing game functionality preserved
  - New crop can be added via JSON file
  - ECS supports unlimited entities efficiently
  - Save/load handles complex nested data

  🔧 Recommended Technology Decisions

  Leverage Your Existing Excellence:
  - Keep pygame-gui: You've already mastered it, and it can handle this complexity
  - Keep Python: Your event system and architecture patterns are solid
  - Keep existing art pipeline: Focus on systems, not graphics

  Strategic Technology Additions:
  - YAML for data files: More human-readable than JSON for content creation
  - sqlite3: For complex queries on save data and content relationships
  - dataclasses: For type-safe entity definitions
  - pytest: For comprehensive testing of complex systems

  💡 Key Strategic Decisions

  Decision Point 1: Development Approach
  - Option A: Full rebuild with new architecture (recommended)
  - Option B: Gradual migration from current codebase (higher risk)

  Decision Point 2: Content Strategy
  - Option A: Build content creation tools first (recommended for long-term)
  - Option B: Hand-craft initial content (faster short-term)

  Decision Point 3: Team Strategy
