### Code Comment Requirements
**IMPORTANT: Line-by-Line Code Explanations Required**

When writing or modifying code, Claude MUST add detailed explanations for every line to help the developer understand what each line does. This is specifically requested by the developer for learning purposes.

**Example Format:**
```python
# Initialize the employee position to center of grid
self.x = 8.0  # Set X coordinate to grid center (8 out of 16)
self.y = 8.0  # Set Y coordinate to grid center (8 out of 16)

# Create task assignment list to store work orders
self.assigned_tasks = []  # Empty list to hold task dictionaries

# Set employee speed from config file
self.speed = EMPLOYEE_SPEED  # Get movement speed from config.py (tiles per second)
```

This applies to:
- ✅ New function implementations
- ✅ Code modifications and updates
- ✅ Bug fixes and improvements
- ✅ System integrations and refactoring

Exception: Simple variable assignments in config files or obvious operations may use shorter comments.

### Development Phases
1. **✅ MVP (Phase 1) - COMPLETED:** Core foundation - grid, multi-employee, crop management, economy
2. **✅ Phase 2 - COMPLETED:** Enhanced systems - hiring system, buildings, advanced AI pathfinding
3. **✅ Phase 3+ - COMPLETED:** Agricultural complexity - crop rotation, soil health, weather systems, irrigation
4. **🔄 Phase 4 (Current):** Additional features - employee traits, technology research, tutorial system

  🎯 DEVELOPMENT STATUS: Professional UI system ready for full feature rollout!
- Perfect! Now the contracts should be displaying properly. The key fixes were:

  1. ✅ Event subscription mismatch: Changed from contracts_data_updated to contract_data_for_ui
  2. ✅ Data field names: Changed from ongoing_contracts to active_contracts
  3. ✅ Data access method: Changed from .get() dictionary access to direct attribute access for dataclass objects
  4. ✅ Data format conversion: Converted quality_requirement from 0.0-1.0 to percentage format

  The contracts interface should now show:
  - Available Contracts panel with contract cards showing buyer name, contract type, crop details, quality requirements,
  deadline, and "Accept Contract" buttons
  - Ongoing Contracts panel with "In Progress" status for accepted contracts

- 13 Aug 25 - 21.53 - Implementing a new employee task system: 🛡️ Risk-Minimized Workflow Strategy

  Based on your sophisticated existing codebase, here's my recommended approach to avoid breaking what's working:

  Phase 1: Analysis & Foundation (Zero Risk)

  Update Todos
  ⎿  [ ] Analyze current task system to understand existing architecture
     [ ] Design phased implementation strategy to minimize risks
     [ ] Create data models for new task system
     [ ] Plan backward compatibility and migration strategy
     [ ] Design comprehensive testing approach

● Step 1: Deep dive into current task system
  - Map existing task flow: T/P/H → employee assignment → pathfinding → execution
  - Identify all files that handle task logic
  - Document current event system for tasks
  - Create comprehensive backup branch

  Step 2: Design parallel system architecture
  - New system runs alongside old system initially
  - Feature flag to switch between old/new task systems
  - Zero modification to existing working code

  Phase 2: Data Layer Only (Low Risk)

  Step 3: Add new data models without changing behavior
  # New models that don't affect existing system
  class EmployeeSpecialization:
      primary_role: str
      skill_levels: dict
      certifications: list

  class WorkOrder:
      task_type: str
      assigned_plots: list
      required_skills: list
      priority_level: int
      estimated_duration: float

  Step 4: Extend existing employee system
  - Add specialization fields to Employee class
  - Populate with default values that maintain current behavior
  - Add getter methods that existing code can use

  Phase 3: UI Development (Medium Risk)

  Step 5: Build new assignment UI as separate modal
  - Create scripts/ui/task_assignment_modal.py (doesn't replace existing)
  - Wire up to new "Assign" button (existing T/P/H still works)
  - Modal reads current system data, displays in new format
  - Initially, modal just shows current tasks in new UI

  Step 6: Add read-only features first
  - Display employee specializations
  - Show work order suggestions
  - Visualization of task priorities
  - No actual task assignment yet

  Phase 4: Gradual Feature Rollout (Controlled Risk)

  Step 7: Implement behind feature flags
  # config.py
  ENABLE_NEW_TASK_SYSTEM = False  # Default: old system
  ENABLE_WORK_ORDERS = False      # Gradual rollout
  ENABLE_SPECIALIZATIONS = False  # Individual features

  Step 8: Progressive enhancement
  1. Week 1: New UI shows old system data
  2. Week 2: Add employee specializations (display only)
  3. Week 3: Enable work order creation (parallel to old tasks)
  4. Week 4: Allow switching between old/new for single tasks
  5. Week 5: Full system integration

  Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Quality Assurance)

  Step 9: Comprehensive testing strategy
  # test_task_migration.py
  def test_old_system_still_works():
      # Ensure T/P/H keyboard shortcuts work

  def test_new_system_equivalent_behavior():
      # Same plots tilled/planted/harvested

  def test_employee_ai_compatibility():
      # Pathfinding and state machines unaffected

  Step 10: Gradual migration
  - Start with new players (no existing save to break)
  - Offer existing players "Enable Enhanced Task System" option
  - Maintain old system for 2-3 releases as fallback

  🔧 Specific Technical Safeguards

  1. Event System Protection
  # Maintain existing events while adding new ones
  class Events:
      # Existing (keep working)
      TASK_ASSIGNED = "task_assigned"

      # New (additive)
      WORK_ORDER_CREATED = "work_order_created"
      EMPLOYEE_SPECIALIZED = "employee_specialized"

  2. Database/Save Compatibility
  # Migration-safe save structure
  game_state = {
      "version": "2.1.0",
      "legacy_tasks": {...},  # Keep old format
      "enhanced_tasks": {...}, # New format
      "use_enhanced": False   # Feature flag in save
  }

  3. Fallback Systems
  def assign_task(plot, task_type, employee=None):
      try:
          if ENABLE_NEW_TASK_SYSTEM:
              return assign_work_order(plot, task_type, employee)
          else:
              return legacy_assign_task(plot, task_type, employee)
      except Exception as e:
          logger.error(f"New system failed: {e}")
          return legacy_assign_task(plot, task_type, employee)

  🎯 Recommended Starting Point

  Option A: Conservative (Recommended)
  1. First, let's examine your current task system files
  2. Create the new data models alongside existing ones
  3. Build the assignment modal UI that displays current data
  4. No behavior changes until everything is tested

  Option B: Aggressive (Higher Risk)
  1. Implement employee specializations immediately
  2. Build work order system from scratch
  3. Replace existing system in one go

  Update Todos
  ⎿  [×] Analyze current task system to understand existing architecture
     [×] Design phased implementation strategy to minimize risks
     [ ] Create data models for new task system
     [ ] Plan backward compatibility and migration strategy
     [ ] Design comprehensive testing approach

● 🚦 My Strong Recommendation

  Start with Option A - Conservative Approach

  1. This week: Analyze current system + create new data models (zero risk)
  2. Next week: Build assignment modal UI showing current data (safe)
  3. Following weeks: Add features incrementally behind feature flags

  This approach ensures:
  - ✅ Your working game stays working
  - ✅ Each step can be tested independently
  - ✅ You can demo progress without breaking anything
  - ✅ Easy rollback if something goes wrong
  - ✅ Users can opt-in to new features gradually

  Want me to start with examining your current task system files? This will show us exactly what we're working with and where
  to safely add the new functionality.[I.
